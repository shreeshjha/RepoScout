## What is this?

RepoScout lets you search, discover, and manage repositories across GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket without leaving your terminal. Think of it as a souped-up version of GitHub CLI with semantic search, offline caching, and a slick TUI.

## Features

- üîç **Multi-platform search** - Search GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket simultaneously
- üé® **Beautiful TUI** - Terminal UI that doesn't look like it's from 1985
- üíæ **Smart caching** - Works offline with intelligent SQLite + FTS5 caching
- ü§ñ **AI-powered recommendations** - Semantic search and personalized suggestions
- ‚ö° **Fast** - Async I/O and parallel API requests
- üîß **Flexible** - Use as CLI or interactive TUI

## Installation

### From Source (for now)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreeshjha/RepoScout.git
cd RepoScout
cargo build --release
```

Binary will be at `target/release/reposcout`

## Quick Start

```bash
# Search for repositories
reposcout search "rust tui"

# Show repository details
reposcout show "ratatui/ratatui"

# Launch interactive TUI (coming soon)
reposcout tui
```

## Configuration

RepoScout looks for config at `~/.config/reposcout/config.toml`

```toml
[platforms.github]
token = "ghp_your_token_here"

[platforms.gitlab]
token = "your_gitlab_token"
url = "https://gitlab.com"  # or your self-hosted instance

[cache]
ttl_hours = 24
max_size_mb = 500

[ui]
theme = "dark"
```

## Project Structure

This is a Rust workspace with multiple crates:

- `reposcout-cli` - Command-line interface
- `reposcout-core` - Core business logic and search engine
- `reposcout-tui` - Terminal UI using ratatui
- `reposcout-api` - API clients for various platforms
- `reposcout-cache` - SQLite-based caching layer

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint
cargo clippy

# Run locally
cargo run -- search "your query"
```

## Why Another Git Tool?

Good question. Here's why RepoScout exists:

1. **GitHub CLI is great but limited** - Only works with GitHub
2. **Web interfaces are slow** - Context switching between terminal and browser sucks
3. **Offline mode matters** - Airplane coding, slow connections, API rate limits
4. **Discovery is hard** - Finding quality repos matching your needs shouldn't require 20 browser tabs
5. **I wanted to build something cool in Rust** - Most honest reason
